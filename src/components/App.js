              After their 12-week journey to becoming Full-Stack Developers, our students have grown their technical
              skills. These students have gone from little to no experience to learning HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React and
              then diving into .NET or Ruby on Rails to round out their full-stack understanding. We are proud to
              present to you our graduating students from Cohort X.
